        <h2 id="Biography">Biography</h2>
        <p><strong>Edward Davis Wood Jr.</strong>-American director, screenwriter, producer, editor, actor and writer.
            He was
            awarded
            the title of <q>worst director of all time</q>, which was given to him by two film critics - Harry and
            Michael
            Medved - in his book <q><b>The Golden Turkey Awards</b></q> in <i>1980</i> (<u>that is, two years after
                Wood's death</u>).
            Edward Davis Wood Jr. was born <time datetime="1924-10-10"><em>October 10, 1924</time> in Poughkeepsie, New
            York</em>. His mother always wanted a girl,
            and his father, who served as a postman, was indifferent to the sex of the unborn child. As a result, Ed was
            dressed in women's clothing, and this later became his passion. In this sense, the case when on Halloween he
            won the 1st prize by wearing a woman's dress is indicative. In the <i>1940s</i>, at the age of 17, Wood went
            to
            fight in <b>World War II</b>, where he participated in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Passionate about dressing
            up, he
            wore lingerie under his uniform. But since Wood was hiding his transvestism, he was afraid that he would be
            hurt and that his secret would be revealed. After the war, he leaves for Los Angeles to make films.
            Initially, Wood did small assignments in Hollywood.
        <p>Wood's films starred his favorite actor, <s>Count Dracula</s> Bela Lugosi, who was also his friend. He was
            married twice, with
            his first wife, Norma McCarthy, he has a child. Ed Wood often shot 20-30 scenes a day, in most cases from
            the first take.</p>
        <p><b>Edward Wood's most famous quotes:</b>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to know me, watch the movie <q>Glen or Glenda</q>. This is me, this is my story, no
                    question. But <q>Plan 9</q> is my beauty and pride. We used Cadillac wheels for the UFO image.</li>
                <li>A person may dwell so long upon a thought that it may take him a prisoner.</li>
            </ul>
